TimiRGeN v0.99.11 (Date: 12/02/2020)
===============================
* Fixed bug introduced to getIDs_miR_mousetohuman.

* Changed function name to dloadData.
* Editted SavePlots function again to make output larger.

TimiRGeN v0.99.24 (Date: 19/02/2020)
===============================
* Editted vignette.
* Tested on windows - no errors or warnings but >20m check + tests time.

TimiRGeN v0.99.3 (Date: 19/02/2020)
===============================
* Uploaded on TimiRGeN github and preparing bioconductor build.

TimiRGeN v0.99.31 (Date: 19/02/2020)
===============================
* Uploaded on TimiRGeN github and preparing bioconductor build.

TimiRGeN v0.99.32 (Date: 19/02/2020)
===============================
* Removed global variables are no longer removed as it causes errors in bioconductor checks.

TimiRGeN v0.99.322 (Date: 22/02/2020)
===============================
* Made gmt files available as data for the vignette.
* Editted dloadGMT function to hopefully work in bioconductor submission.

TimiRGeN v0.99.323 (Date: 22/02/2020)
===============================
* Changes Pmat to be stored as metadata rather than in ExperimentList.

TimiRGeN v0.99.324 (Date: 25/02/2020)
===============================
* Added the mining matrix as a internal data set so the databases do not have to be downloaded during vignette-building. This is causing an error on the bioconductor systems as their system cannot download these files during build.

TimiRGeN v0.99.325 (Date: 25/02/2020)
===============================
* Changed Pmat to be stored in metadata in tests and ReturnClusters Example.

TimiRGeN v0.99.326 (Date: 25/02/2020)
===============================
* Changed tests to match testthat results from bioconductor.

TimiRGeN v0.99.4 (Date: 24/03/2020)
===============================
* Now using MAE accessors instead of @/$ to access data in MAE objects.
* Changed all functions to report back to common MAE objects.
* Changed dloadmiRTarBase and miRTarBase_data to internally stored data, this was due to miRTarBase servers being down, most likely due to COVID-19 related reasons.
* Removed several functions which were too 'experimental' i.e get_IDs_miR_mousetohuman, get_IDs_mouse_mousetohuman because they were too clunky and prone to bugs. May re-release these in future updates of the package.
* Changed vignette to use be more streamline, more to the point and use MAE object more approproately.
* Vast majority of code now only uses <- to assign new objects.
* Using indents to make the code easier to read.
* Added some description to some R functions.

TimiRGeN v0.99.415 (Date: 25/03/2020)
===============================
* Remade CreateCluster function so that it does not cause errors during bioconductor checks.
* Removed some tests to speed up bioconductor checks.
* Modified some examples to speed up bioconductor checks.
* Reduced size of help files by re-formatting descriptions.

TimiRGeN v0.99.4152 (Date: 18/04/2020)
===============================
* Added data files to get around using CreateClusters in vignette, this seems
to cause a bug in some systems.

TimiRGeN v0.99.4154 (Date: 22/04/2020)
===============================
* Changed function names to be consistent with captionCaps format.
* Updated vignette and reformated the contents method.
* Changed data file names, now no data files start with a Cap.

TimiRGeN v0.99.4155 (Date: 27/04/2020)
===============================
* Moved most packages TimiRGeN depends on to dependencies, and removed these 
packages in examples and from the vignette.
* Fixed bugs in createClusters and dloadMirtarbase.
* Removed library calls from the tests.
