The smiRk package is made for researchers that wish to further analyse time
series microRNA-mRNA data sets after differential expression analysis. 
smiRk offers users the ability to integrate the multi-omic data, 
functionally analyse Human or Mouse data, and to visualise this. Data can 
easily be exported to Cytoscape of Pathvisio. 

Ideally, this package will offer users direction and hypothesis generation.
To whittle down potentially millions of microRNA-mRNA interactions to a 
handful, which would be more suitable for further computational or experimental
work. One unique output is the ability to generate gene regulatory
networks from the output of smiRk and Pathvisio. 

Please read the vignette for more information.
