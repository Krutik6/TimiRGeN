The TimiRGeN package is made for researchers that wish to further analyse time series microRNA-mRNA data sets after differential expression analysis.
TimiRGeN offers users the ability to integrate the multi-omic data, 
functionally analyse Human or Mouse data, and to visualise this. Data can 
easily be exported to Cytoscape of Pathvisio. 

Ideally, this package will offer users direction and hypothesis generation.
To whittle down potentially millions of microRNA-mRNA interactions to a 
handful, which would be more suitable for further computational or experimental work. 
One unique output is the ability to generate gene regulatory networks from the output of TimiRGeN and Pathvisio. 

Please read the vignette for more information, and follow the instructions on  the Pathvisio_GRN_guide for help in constructing networks where GRN construction can be made.
