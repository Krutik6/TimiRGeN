The TimiRGeN package is made for researchers that wish to further analyse time series microRNA-mRNA data sets after differential expression analysis.
TimiRGeN offers users the ability to integrate the multi-omic data, 
functionally analyse Human or Mouse data, and to visualise this. Data can 
easily be exported to cytoscape or pathvisio. 

Ideally, this package will offer users direction and hypothesis generation.
To whittle down potentially millions of microRNA-mRNA interactions to a 
handful of interactions which are effecting a signalling pathway of interest, 
which is suitable for further computational or experimental work. 
One unique output is the ability to generate gene regulatory networks from 
imporing output from TimiRGeN into pathvisio.

Please read the vignette for more information, and follow the instructions on 
the Pathvisio_GRN_guide found in the /inst directory, for help in constructing networks where GRNs generation can be made from.
