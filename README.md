The TimiRGeN package is made for researchers that wish to analyse time series microRNA-mRNA data sets after differential expression analysis.
TimiRGeN offers users the ability to integrate the multi-omic data, 
perform functionally analysis, and to visualise this. Data can 
easily be exported to cytoscape or pathvisio. 

Please read the [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TimiRGeN/inst/doc/TimiRGeN_tutorial.html) for more information . Follow the instructions on the [Pathvisio_GRN_guide](https://github.com/Krutik6/TimiRGeN/issues/2) found in the issues of the github repository for help in constructing networks and further development of GRNs.
