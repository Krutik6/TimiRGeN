\usage{
quickDot(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Dataframe within a list including count information,confidence
scores and wikipathway information. This is the output from the enrichWiki
function. It will be stored as metadata within the MAE used in the enrichWiki
function. Data can be retrieved using [[i]][[j]] on the output of enrichWiki.}

\item{Y}{String which is associated to the name of a nested
dataframes. This is the output from the enrichWiki function. It will be
stored as metadata within the MAE used in the enrichWiki function. Data can
be retrieved using [[i]][j] on the output of enrichWiki.}
}
\value{
Dot plot showing which pathways are most enriched for genes found
in a time point found in all gene types or in a time point within a gene
type.
}
\description{
Creates a dot plot which compares the confidence levels for
each wikipathway association to the data. The number of genes in common
between a pathway and the input data are taken into account to generate
confidence scores. This function is to be used specifically for a single
time point at a time, or if s analysis has been done, then a single time
point within a single gene type (mir or mRNA).
